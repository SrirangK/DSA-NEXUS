In large parking lots, especially those with complex layouts, it’s inefficient to assign parking slots manually or randomly. The goal is to automate the process of finding the most optimal parking slot for a vehicle entering the premises by considering factors such as:
  Distance from the entry point
  Proximity to the building entrance
  Ease of exit (distance to the exit point)

The parking layout is represented as a graph, where each node corresponds to a junction or slot, and edges represent paths with associated weights (e.g., distances). However, not all nodes are valid parking slots — some are reserved as entry, exit, or building entrances.
